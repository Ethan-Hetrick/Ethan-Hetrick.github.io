about_title: About me
about_content: |
  I am a detail-oriented, self-sufficient, and proactive worker with a life science background
  and 4 years of professional experience in bioinformatics, along with three completed semesters
  of my Bioinformatics PhD at Georgia Tech. I am pursuing roles that combine computational biology,
  leadership, and project management, with the long-term goal of serving as a principal investigator
  or technical lead. Open communication, empathy, and collaboration are core values in how I work.
