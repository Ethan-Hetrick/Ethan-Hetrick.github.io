about_title: About me
about_content: |
  I am a Bioinformatics Developer at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a
  PhD student in Bioinformatics at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I specialize in developing
  bioinformatics pipelines and tools, primarily using Nextflow, to support public health research
  and surveillance. My interests include workflow development, high-performance computing,
  comparative genomics, metagenomics, and machine learning applications in biology.
  
  Outside of work and school, I enjoy skateboarding, weightlifting and playing jazz on the trombone.
  
  Feel free to reach out via email or connect with me on GitHub!
